          Oles Honchar University, where I am studying for a specialty "Computer
          engineering" (specialty code â€” 123). I am 18 years old, and since the
          fall In 2022, I am actively engaged in web application development,
          all the time expanding your skills and deepening your industry
          knowledge programming. In development, I adhere to the principles of
          clean code (SOLID, KISS, DRY) and use modern architectural approaches,
          including REST API and client-server architecture. This allows for
          scalable and easily maintainable solutions to build products that
          solve real user problems.
